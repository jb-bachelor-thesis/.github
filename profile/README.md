Hello,

This organization contains a collection of performance testing applications and tools I developed as part of my bachelor's thesis at TH NÃ¼rnberg Georg-Simon Ohm in collaboration with DATEV eG.  The thesis is titled "Reactive Programming in Java: An Analysis of Application Performance and Developer Experience".

The benchmarks target JDK 23 and are Spring WebFlux or MVC applications with minimal endpoints designed to test specific functionalities.

<!--

You are very welcome to participate in my survey among software developers, which focuses on the experience of working with reactive code and best practices for adopting rective programming in a given workspace.
